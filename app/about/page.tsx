      <p>
        <strong>AI Visions</strong> is an ongoing experiment in cinematic,
        minimalist storytelling.  Each entry in the archive conjures
        fragments of a near‑future world through images, loops and micro‑stories.
        The tone is restrained yet evocative, inviting you to fill in the
        gaps between what is shown and what is suggested.

        The project draws inspiration from glitch art, speculative fiction
        and the aesthetics of recovered transmissions.  The absence of
        realistic human figures allows the landscapes, objects and signals
        themselves to become the protagonists.  Think of these works as
        postcards from tomorrow — poetic and mysterious messages left for
        those willing to listen.
